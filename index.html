Subject 2# appears to be interested in multiple characters. Some of them are female characters from bleach with such information maybe we could contain this â–‡â–‡â–‡â–‡â–‡â–‡ â–‡â–‡.

                MTF unit â–‡â–‡â–‡ â–‡â–‡â–‡ had made contact with subject 2# Julius. The subject was found in a state of gooning. The MTF unit had to use extreme measures to contain the subject.

                Subject 2# Julius cant be contained so it is advised to monitor him 24/7. If the subject is seen â–‡â–‡â–‡â–‡â–‡â–‡ it is advised to set up a 20km perimeter around the subject. If somebody starts getting gooning material on thier phones even though they had not gotten in the entire day that person must be quarantined and evacuation must comence of that area. That it's a sigh that subject 2# will make thier appearance.
